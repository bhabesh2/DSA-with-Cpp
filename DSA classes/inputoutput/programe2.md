## intial code
```
#include<iostream>

c++ has some important files to do various activities like for input or output etc.

this above line import the files of c++ to do operation. <iostream> is the header that works for taking input and output.

int main() --> the programme will execute from here. compiler will look for main to start compilation.

std::cout<<"hello"<< endl;

std---> is the short form of standard.

cout--> is used to print the output.

\n --> to print a new line.(regex)

endl---> to print a next line.

return 0 ---> this will specify our compiler that the function is finished and now exit from this function. anything we write after the return 0 nothing will be print or even compiler will ignore.

{
    this is a block for a particular programme.
}
```
**note**
```
always place semi-colon after the end of a statement.

to print the output we have to linked std before cout every time to stop that we can use 

using namespace std; just after the #include<iostream>
```
**note**
```
<< incertion we mostly use in cout. 

>> extraction this is used to take input.
